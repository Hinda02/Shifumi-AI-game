## 👨‍💻 How the AI Works
The AI tracks player moves and stores a move history.  
It detects repeating patterns and predicts the next move.  
If no pattern is found, it uses frequency analysis to counter the player's most played move.  
AI has a 10% randomness factor to keep the game interesting.  

## 🏆 How to Play

The AI will predict your move and choose its response.  
The game updates your score based on the result:  
✅ Win → +1 Win  
🤝 Draw → +1 Draw  
❌ Loss → +1 Loss
